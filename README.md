beachomize
==========
Software for organizing shuffled beach volleyball tournaments with a matchmaking algorithm. Implemented in python and tkinter.

![main_example](http://beachomize.de/image/main_example.png)

### Game mode
#### Shuffling
In each round, teams of two are randomly formed
#### Matchmaking
After creating teams, fixtures are set based on MMR (match making rating) of each player. The team with the best average MMR plays against the second-best. MMRs are updated after each game.

Features
--------
### Customize your tournament

Get suggestions for number of games to play. Adjust the game number by letting player 1 run "outside the competition".
### Let players request to wait

Usually the players that wait are randomly determined each round, but players can also request to skip a round.
### Adjust font size

### Auto-save
The state of the tournament is automatically saved on the hard drive to avoid data loss, for example when the window is closed accidentially. The most recent auto-save can be loaded on start-up.
### Localization
Language files can be added. Currently English and German are available.

Installation
------------
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/RichardGoerler/beachomize/releases) or clone the [git repository](https://github.com/RichardGoerler/beachomize).
### Prerequisites
In order to run **beachomize** you need to have python installed on your machine. python2 is recommended, but it should also run work python3. The python packages tkinter and numpy are required.
#### Install python2, tkinter and numpy
##### Linux
Use your package manager to install the packages *python*, *python-tk* and *python-numpy*
For instance, on Ubuntu **sudo apt-get install python python-tk python-numpy** should work in most cases.
##### Windows
On Windows, *Anaconda* is usually the way to run python. You can download the windows version [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads#windows). In that installation, the required packages should already be included.

Usage
-----
Before starting your tournament, make sure you place you player names in the file *players.txt*. Each line should consist of a player name and the initial MMR of that player (default 0).
In your anaconda or linux console, navigate to the **beachomize** directory and type **python gui&#46;py**
